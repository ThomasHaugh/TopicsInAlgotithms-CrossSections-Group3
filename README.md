#CrossSection Offsets using Veronoi Diagrams

Using Voronoi diagrams we can construct offsets using a simple algorithm outlined in the paper below to compute the offset of a collection of polygons.
This is for the New College Topics In Algorithms class Spring 2015. The codebase was provided to us by professor Kalmanovich.
